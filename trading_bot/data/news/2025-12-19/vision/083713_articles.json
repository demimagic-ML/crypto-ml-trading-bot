      "summary": "Bitcoin surged above $87,000 following the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike, which weakened the yen and boosted risk appetite. The confirmation of crypto-friendly regulators at the CFTC and FDIC adds long-term bullish sentiment. Institutional interest in Ripple assets remains strong despite limited broader market participation. This combination of macro-driven momentum and regulatory optimism suggests a high-impact bullish catalyst."
