      "summary": "Bitcoin is facing strong selling pressure near the $85,000 level, triggering over $550 million in liquidations across altcoins. This indicates a potential breakdown in momentum, with bearish sentiment spreading. Regulatory uncertainty around U.S. market structure and custody rules adds to volatility. The recent CPI print briefly lifted Bitcoin but failed to sustain gains, suggesting weak follow-through. Institutional moves are not evident here, but liquidation events signal retail-driven sell-offs."
