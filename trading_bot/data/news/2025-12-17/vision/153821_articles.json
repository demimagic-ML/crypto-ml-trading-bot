      "summary": "The top news highlights a bearish shift in crypto sentiment with memecoins collapsing after a massive bubble, Bitcoin nearing critical support levels, and regulatory developments from the FDIC on stablecoins. Institutional moves like EquiLend’s partnership signal growing adoption but are offset by macro risks. The combination of regulatory uncertainty, market capitulation, and weakening altcoin momentum suggests caution. Breaking news includes the FDIC proposal and memecoin crash, both high-impact events."
