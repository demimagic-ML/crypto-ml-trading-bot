      "summary": "Bitcoin has retraced sharply from recent highs near $90,000, breaking below $88,000, triggering a broad sell-off across crypto and related stocks. XRP is down 5%, and institutional sentiment appears cautious. While a regulatory meeting with Senator Tim Scott may signal future policy developments, immediate market action is driven by profit-taking and technical breakdowns. The correction suggests short-term bearish momentum, warranting caution or selling pressure."
