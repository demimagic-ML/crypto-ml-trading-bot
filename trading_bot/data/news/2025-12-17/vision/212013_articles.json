      "summary": "Bitcoin has dropped below $88,000 amid a reversal in momentum, driven by macro concerns and potential regulatory scrutiny. Regulatory discussions with senators signal possible upcoming legislation that could impact market structure. The Federal Reserve’s large-scale bill purchases add uncertainty to market liquidity. Combined with negative sentiment across major altcoins (DOT, ETH), this environment suggests bearish pressure. While the Fed move is not directly crypto-specific, its implications for broader risk assets are high. Institutional and regulatory developments are present, but current price action reflects weakening demand."
