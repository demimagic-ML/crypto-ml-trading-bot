      "summary": "The top headlines suggest a mix of strong bullish catalysts from institutional expectations and regulatory optimism, countered by a major security event. The Bitwise forecast signals confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, while political openness to crypto regulation could unlock market growth. Despite the Nomad hack, which is negative but not systemic, the overall sentiment leans bullish due to macro-level tailwinds. This combination supports a strong buy signal ahead of potential catalysts in early 2026."
