Regulatory themes dominate, which may cause volatility, but no immediate catalysts for strong directional movement."

      "summary": "Recent news highlights a volatile market with Bitcoin briefly reaching $90K before a pullback, signaling potential exhaustion after a rally. Institutional moves include Hut 8’s major AI partnership and DTCC’s entry into tokenized securities, indicating growing institutional adoption. While bullish momentum was present, the reversal suggests caution. Regulatory and infrastructural developments are positive for long-term adoption but do not yet justify aggressive positioning."
