      "summary": "Bitcoin and broader crypto markets are testing a $3 trillion valuation, showing weakness amid macro concerns despite institutional interest. Grayscale highlights growing institutional adoption in 2026, while regulatory developments (FDIC stablecoin rule, Senate probe) add uncertainty. XRP faces near-term technical pressure below $1.93. The mix of bearish price action and bullish institutional sentiment creates a neutral-to-cautious trading environment."

While there are bullish signals from adoption, regulatory uncertainty and long-term risks temper overall sentiment. The most immediate impact comes from Bhutan’s BTC pledge and UK regulatory consultations, but no major ETF or hack events are reported."
