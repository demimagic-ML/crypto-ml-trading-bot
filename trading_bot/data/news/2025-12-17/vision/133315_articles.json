      "summary": "Bitcoin is under pressure as the broader crypto market tests a $3 trillion floor, driven by bearish momentum. However, there are contrasting bullish signals from macro developments like China’s stronger yuan and Bhutan’s institutional Bitcoin commitment. Despite these positive catalysts, immediate market sentiment remains negative due to ongoing selling pressure. The dominant theme is short-term bearishness, but long-term adoption stories may offer support."
