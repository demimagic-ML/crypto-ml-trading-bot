      "summary": "Bitcoin and major cryptos are experiencing downward pressure as the market approaches the $3 trillion valuation threshold, with regulatory scrutiny and institutional positioning emerging as key drivers. Grayscale's outlook on 2026 underscores growing institutional interest, but near-term price action reflects bearish momentum, particularly in XRP. Regulatory developments, including FDIC proposals and Senate probes, add uncertainty, potentially amplifying volatility. The combination of breaking market movement and regulatory risk suggests a cautious stance."
