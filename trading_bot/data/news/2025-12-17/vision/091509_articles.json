      "summary": "Bitcoin and broader crypto markets are showing weakness amid a test of the $3 trillion market cap level, with negative sentiment driven by BTC's decline and XRP’s breakdown below key support. Grayscale's outlook highlights growing institutional interest, but regulatory uncertainty and macro pressures remain dominant. The FDIC's proposed stablecoin rule adds regulatory risk. While institutional adoption is a bullish long-term signal, current price action suggests near-term bearish momentum."
