      "summary": "The top news includes regulatory developments around stablecoins with the FDIC proposing new rules, a short-term rebound in Bitcoin price after a dip, and institutional interest via American Bitcoin’s rise in public BTC treasury rankings. While there is some bullish momentum in price recovery, regulatory uncertainty and lack of major ETF or adoption milestones keep overall sentiment neutral. The FDIC proposal is high-impact due to its regulatory nature, but no immediate catalysts are confirmed."
