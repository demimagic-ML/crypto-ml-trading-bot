      "summary": "Bitcoin is showing weakness against stocks and other cryptos, testing a key $3T market cap level, but analysts suggest this underperformance could set up a bullish rebound in January. Institutional interest remains strong with Grayscale outlining 2026 themes, while regulatory developments like the FDIC’s stablecoin proposal add uncertainty. The overall tone is neutral—weakness present but not panic, with potential upside if macro conditions improve."
