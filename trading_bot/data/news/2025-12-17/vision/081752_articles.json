      "summary": "Bitcoin and major cryptos are under pressure as the market approaches a $3 trillion valuation, with mixed signals from regulatory developments and institutional outlooks. Grayscale's 2026 institutional adoption themes suggest long-term bullishness, but near-term bearish momentum is driven by macro weakness and regulatory scrutiny. The FDIC's proposed stablecoin rule and Senator Warren's crypto probe bill add uncertainty. While some institutional interest remains, current price action suggests caution."

While Visa’s move is bullish for broader adoption, the fraud accusations introduce risk. No major ETF approvals or hacks reported. The overall sentiment is neutral due to mixed signals."
