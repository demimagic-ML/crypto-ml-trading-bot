The ongoing talks between crypto leaders and senators on market structure could lead to future policy changes, but immediate sentiment is bearish due to technical breakdowns and profit-taking. Institutional positioning appears cautious, and the drop below $88,000 suggests potential further downside unless new catalysts emerge."
