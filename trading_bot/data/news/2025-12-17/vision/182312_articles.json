      "summary": "Bitcoin has dropped below $88,000 after a short-lived rally, with bearish momentum emerging due to macroeconomic factors and institutional positioning shifts. The Fed’s large-scale bond purchases may be contributing to market volatility. Robinhood is seen as outperforming Coinbase in crypto adoption, indicating potential institutional tailwinds. However, the breaking news of Bitcoin’s reversal suggests a near-term sell-off, especially given the 'buy the rumor, sell the news' dynamic."
