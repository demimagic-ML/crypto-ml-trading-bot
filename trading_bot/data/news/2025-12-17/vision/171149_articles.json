      "summary": "The latest news from CoinDesk highlights a bearish sentiment in the crypto market due to Federal Reserve monetary actions failing to stimulate growth, Bitcoin testing critical support levels, and ETF markets showing weakness. These factors suggest a potential downward pressure on prices, especially if support is broken. Institutional caution and lack of momentum indicate a high-risk environment for buyers."

While there are bullish elements (e.g., institutional adoption via Securitize), concerns about security and regulatory uncertainty dominate. The headline questioning Bitcoin’s cycle suggests potential market fatigue, but no definitive breakout or crash signal is confirmed yet."

While regulatory optimism and institutional moves are positive, the delisting risk adds uncertainty. No major ETF or macro event is confirmed yet, so impact remains moderate."
