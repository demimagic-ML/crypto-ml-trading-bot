      "summary": "Recent news highlights bullish sentiment around Bitcoin’s potential rebound in January after underperforming equities in Q4, supported by derivative positioning pointing to a $85k–$100k price range. Regulatory developments including the FDIC’s stablecoin proposal and Senate scrutiny of crypto markets add institutional context. While no ETF or major hack is reported, institutional-level policy discussions suggest elevated market attention. The bounce from lows with caution on near-term support below $80k signals volatility ahead, but overall tone favors upward momentum."

      "summary": "Recent news highlights a significant $358M outflow from Bitcoin ETFs, signaling potential institutional disengagement and bearish sentiment. The Bank of Canada's stablecoin framework introduces regulatory clarity but may limit innovation. Combined with ongoing regulatory scrutiny from the UK and SEC, these developments suggest heightened caution in the market. While not a direct crash signal, the confluence of regulatory focus and ETF outflows indicates a risk-off environment, warranting a defensive stance."

      "summary": "The top news highlights a strong institutional bullish forecast for Bitcoin by Bitwise, signaling potential new all-time highs in 2026. Regulatory optimism from potential bipartisan support at the SEC and CFTC adds structural tailwinds. Meanwhile, a major FTC enforcement case against a crypto operator underscores ongoing risks but also regulatory scrutiny that may improve market integrity. This mix of macro optimism and regulatory progress supports a bullish bias."
