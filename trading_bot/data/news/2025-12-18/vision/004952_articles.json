Institutional adoption is signaled by Hut 8’s major AI partnership, but security threats remain evident with reports of malware targeting crypto holdings. The overall sentiment is bearish due to the rapid sell-off post-rally, which could trigger further downside pressure. Given the breaking nature of the price action and institutional involvement, this warrants immediate attention."
