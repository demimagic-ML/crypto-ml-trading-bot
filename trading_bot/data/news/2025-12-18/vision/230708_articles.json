      "summary": "Bitcoin is experiencing a sharp pullback from recent highs following a softer-than-expected U.S. CPI print, which initially lifted prices but now has led to profit-taking. The market sentiment is bearish across major cryptos including XRP and DOT. Regulatory scrutiny from the SEC on crypto custody adds uncertainty. Coinbase's positive institutional news offers a counterpoint, but overall momentum is down. This is breaking news with high market impact due to macroeconomic data and regulatory developments."
