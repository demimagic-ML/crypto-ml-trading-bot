      "summary": "The top news highlights strong institutional demand via Bitcoin ETF inflows ($450M), suggesting bullish momentum. However, MSCI’s proposed rules may trigger large-scale sell-offs, introducing downside risk. Ethereum commentary from Buterin adds long-term narrative support for crypto adoption. Regulatory developments around RWAs and DeFi also remain relevant. The mix of positive ETF flows and regulatory threats creates a high-impact environment where 'buy the rumor, sell the news' applies—especially with ETF inflows being a bullish catalyst."
