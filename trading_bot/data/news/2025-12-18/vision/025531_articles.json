Meanwhile, Bitcoin has dropped below $86,000, triggering market concern about a possible bottom. Regulatory movement is highlighted by the CFTC chief’s potential move to MoonPay, indicating institutional interest.

The combination of institutional moves and regulatory signals creates high-impact uncertainty."
