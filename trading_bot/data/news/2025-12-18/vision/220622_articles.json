      "summary": "Bitcoin and broader crypto markets are showing bearish momentum after a sharp pullback from recent highs following a weaker-than-expected CPI print. The market reacted negatively, with Bitcoin dropping below $86,000 and XRP and DOT also declining. Regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. SEC on crypto custody adds uncertainty, while Coinbase’s positive institutional reception suggests some resilience in adoption. However, breaking news of a market reversal post-CPI data dominates sentiment."
