      "summary": "Recent news highlights bearish sentiment due to falling inflation reducing macro-driven Bitcoin demand, regulatory headwinds from the SEC and US Fed restricting banking involvement in crypto, and Ethereum's sharp correction. While some institutional adoption signals exist (e.g., Kalshi integrating TRON), the dominant theme is regulatory caution and market pessimism. The combination of macroeconomic shifts and regulatory pressure suggests a potential downturn in momentum."
