However, this is offset by a security incident involving malware targeting crypto users in Singapore, raising concerns about digital asset safety. Regulatory and macro developments are absent, keeping sentiment neutral. While the Hut 8 news could be bullish on adoption, it's not yet priced in, suggesting caution. The malware report adds risk, but no systemic threat is confirmed."
