      "summary": "Breaking news shows U.S. CPI at 2.7%, which is mildly bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin. The Bitcoin-gold ratio reaching a new low suggests institutional and macro interest in BTC. A major hack by North Korean actors underscores ongoing threats but also reflects high-value targets in the crypto space. Overall, inflation data and relative strength metrics support a bullish bias, while security concerns remain."

      "summary": "The top news includes a major security incident involving a $40M drain from a newly created multisig wallet, signaling ongoing risks in smart contract and wallet security. Regulatory developments from the US Fed suggest potential easing of restrictions on banks engaging with crypto, which could be bullish for adoption. However, the former SEC counsel's commentary on RWA compliance highlights regulatory hurdles. The mixed signals—security risk vs. regulatory progress—create a neutral-to-slightly-bearish sentiment. The $40M hack is breaking and high-impact, while the Fed update may drive longer-term institutional interest."
