      "summary": "The market is currently mixed with institutional interest in XRP via VivoPower, but bearish signals emerging for XRP price below $2. Bitcoin remains volatile ahead of key U.S. inflation data, which could trigger significant moves. Coinbase’s expansion into traditional finance highlights ongoing adoption trends. While there are bullish catalysts (institutional XRP buy), bearish technicals on XRP and macro uncertainty suggest caution."
