      "summary": "Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are experiencing their largest outflows since November 2023, signaling institutional withdrawal amid a broader market decline. Bitcoin is showing a deeper slump with top 100 tokens falling below key technical indicators, reinforcing bearish momentum. Additionally, a major development in the ecosystem — Circle’s acquisition of the Axelar developer team — has triggered a 15% drop in AXL, indicating negative sentiment around project stability. This cluster of events suggests heightened risk aversion and potential further downside in crypto markets."
