      "summary": "The market is showing bearish momentum with Bitcoin and top tokens breaking key support levels. However, there is significant institutional progress in stablecoin adoption via Visa and Circle's $3.5B pilot. While long-term infrastructure developments are positive, immediate price action reflects a sell-off. The 'buy the rumor, sell the news' principle applies—recent bullish sentiment around ETFs or macro trends may have been priced in, triggering profit-taking. Institutional moves remain high-impact but current price action dominates short-term outlook."

There is no major regulatory or ETF announcement, but emerging trends in super apps and network activity suggest structural shifts. Sentiment remains neutral with mixed signals between innovation and declining on-chain metrics."

      "summary": "Recent headlines indicate a significant bearish shift in the crypto market, driven by institutional withdrawal from Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and a broad decline in major cryptocurrencies. The ETF outflows signal risk aversion among large players, which could trigger further downside pressure. While quantum computing concerns are being downplayed, market sentiment is clearly negative due to recent price action and fund flows."
