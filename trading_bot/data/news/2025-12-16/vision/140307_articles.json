While PayPal's bank charter pursuit signals long-term institutional interest, immediate market sentiment is bearish due to price declines and macro concerns. Grayscale's downplay of quantum threats suggests no imminent technical risk, but the current dip may reflect profit-taking or regulatory caution. This is breaking news with high market impact."
