      "summary": "The market shows bullish momentum with regulatory progress on stablecoins (FDIC proposal), institutional adoption signals (American Bitcoin ranking), and new blockchain integrations (Coinbase-Polkadot). The FDIC’s stablecoin rule is a major regulatory development that could catalyze broader crypto acceptance. Price action suggests short-term volatility near $80k, but macro trends favor long-term growth."

      "summary": "Recent news highlights regulatory scrutiny of blockchain privacy tools, JPMorgan’s entry into tokenized finance, and potential US bank-backed stablecoins—indicating growing institutional involvement. However, a 50% drop in the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio and market fear around ETH accumulation suggest bearish sentiment. The mix of bullish institutional moves and bearish macro signals creates volatility. Regulatory developments and FDIC-linked stablecoin plans are high-impact events that could drive 5%+ price swings."
