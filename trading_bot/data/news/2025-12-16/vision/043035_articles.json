      "summary": "Bitcoin dropped to $86,000 amid concerns over delayed rate cuts and broader market weakness from AI stock declines. Institutional moves include PayPal’s push for banking licensure and Japan’s SBI launching a regulated yen stablecoin—both indicating adoption but not enough to offset bearish macro sentiment. Regulatory developments and institutional activity are present, but the dominant theme is market correction due to macroeconomic headwinds."
