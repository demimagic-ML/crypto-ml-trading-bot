      "summary": "The market is showing signs of a bearish trend with Bitcoin and most top cryptocurrencies trading below key moving averages. A major catalyst is the Axelar token's 15% decline following a strategic acquisition by Circle, which signals potential institutional shifts. While there is positive news around stablecoin adoption in Southeast Asia via StraitsX, it is overshadowed by widespread market weakness and negative sentiment. Institutional attention to Bitcoin’s price drop below $0.13 also suggests growing concern."

The news mix reflects cautious optimism in accumulation but bears remain in control."

Grayscale’s downplay of quantum threats adds stability but does not offset immediate sell-off momentum."
