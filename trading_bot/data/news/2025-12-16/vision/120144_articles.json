Institutional caution and negative sentiment around major tokens like Axelar (AXL) suggest continued downward pressure. The Nasdaq's resilience contrasts with crypto weakness, indicating potential risk-off behavior in digital assets. This is breaking news with high market impact, suggesting a cautious or sell stance."

      "summary": "Bitcoin is experiencing rapid accumulation by large holders amid a 30% price decline, suggesting potential short-term weakness but long-term buying pressure. Meanwhile, Gemini's expansion into prediction markets signals growing institutional adoption. However, broad market underperformance relative to Bitcoin raises caution. The combination of macro bearishness and selective bullish activity suggests a volatile environment—wait for confirmation before aggressive moves."

Grayscale’s downplaying of quantum threats adds context but doesn't offset current selling pressure. This is breaking news with significant market impact."
