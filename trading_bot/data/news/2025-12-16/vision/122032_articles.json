      "summary": "Bitcoin is experiencing a notable pullback toward $85,000, with Ethereum and XRP also declining, signaling broader market weakness. While PayPal's move to obtain a banking charter signals long-term institutional interest, the immediate sentiment is bearish due to price action. The news of President Trump potentially pardoning a crypto developer adds speculative intrigue but lacks immediate market impact. Overall, the dominant theme is a short-term bearish correction."
