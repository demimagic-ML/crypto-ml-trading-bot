      "summary": "Bitcoin is showing derivative activity suggesting a potential consolidation in the $85K-$100K range, with no clear breakout signal yet. U.S. Senator Warren has initiated a probe into crypto-related matters tied to Trump, which could impact regulatory sentiment. BNB is outperforming other major cryptos with strong volume, indicating bullish momentum in altcoins. No major ETF approvals or institutional moves reported, but regulatory scrutiny remains a key risk."

      "summary": "The top headlines reflect mixed signals in the crypto market: a regulatory development with Aave ending its SEC probe, which is positive for DeFi sentiment; a potential delisting risk for a Bitcoin-related entity on Nasdaq, indicating market scrutiny; and declining interest in XRP despite past hype. While there are no major ETF approvals or institutional adoption announcements, regulatory clarity on Aave could support broader DeFi confidence. The overall tone is neutral, with risks balanced by developments."
