      "summary": "Bitcoin dropped below $86,000 amid broader market sell-offs driven by AI stock declines and uncertainty around rate cuts. This triggered significant liquidations, with over $500M in long positions wiped out. Meanwhile, PayPal's move to seek a banking license for its PYUSD stablecoin signals institutional adoption but is offset by ongoing skepticism about Bitcoin ETF performance. Regulatory developments and institutional moves are high-impact, but current sentiment is bearish due to macro risks and technical breakdowns."
