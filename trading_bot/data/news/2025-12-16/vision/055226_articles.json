      "summary": "Bitcoin is trading near $85,000 amid a broader crypto sell-off, with Ethereum and XRP also declining. Ripple's expansion of RLUSD signals institutional adoption, but the dominant trend is bearish due to market-wide weakness and potential regulatory caution. Bank of America’s analysts indicate growing interest in on-chain assets, which could support longer-term bullish sentiment, but immediate pressure remains from macro and price action."
