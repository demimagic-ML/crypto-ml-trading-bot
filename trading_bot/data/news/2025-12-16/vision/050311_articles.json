      "summary": "Bitcoin and major altcoins are experiencing downward pressure, with Bitcoin approaching $85,000. While Ripple’s expansion of RLUSD signals adoption progress, the dominant trend is bearish due to market-wide declines. Institutional sentiment from Bank of America suggests a potential regulatory pivot favoring on-chain assets, which could be bullish in the long term but adds uncertainty now. Immediate trading action should prioritize caution due to breaking sell-off."
