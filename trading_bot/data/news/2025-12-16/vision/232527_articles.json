Institutional funding remains positive but does not outweigh regulatory headwinds."

Bitwise's prediction on the Bitcoin cycle adds a bearish long-term outlook, but no immediate catalysts are present. Overall, sentiment is neutral with moderate impact due to conflicting institutional and regulatory developments."
