      "summary": "Bitcoin dropped to $86,000 due to fading expectations of rate cuts and broader market weakness from AI sector concerns. Regulatory progress was stalled with the Senate delaying a crypto market structure bill. Nasdaq's move to extend trading hours reflects institutional interest but is offset by bearish macro trends. The sentiment is clearly bearish with high urgency due to breaking price action and regulatory uncertainty."
