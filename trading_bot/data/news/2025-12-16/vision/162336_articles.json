      "summary": "Recent breaking news shows a bearish market tone with Bitcoin and top cryptocurrencies declining, driven by macroeconomic weakness (rising unemployment), ETF outflows, and negative developments in key crypto projects like Axelar. Institutional moves such as Visa’s stablecoin pilot with Circle suggest ongoing adoption but are overshadowed by broader sell-offs. The U.S. job report is weaker than expected, adding pressure on risk assets. This environment favors caution and potential short-term selling."

No major regulatory or ETF developments are reported. The overall tone is neutral with mixed signals—adoption is progressing, but on-chain activity is cooling."
