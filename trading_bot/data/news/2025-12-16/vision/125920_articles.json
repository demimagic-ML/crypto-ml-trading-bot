      "summary": "The market is showing signs of a broader bearish trend with Bitcoin and 75 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies trading below key technical levels. Institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs appears stagnant despite growing demand, and a major development in the Axelar ecosystem has triggered a sharp sell-off in its token. While there is some positive news around stablecoin adoption in Singapore, the overall sentiment remains negative, driven by macro weakness and liquidity concerns."

Grayscale’s reassurance on quantum threats may provide some stability, but the dominant trend is downward pressure. This breaking news warrants caution and potential selling."
