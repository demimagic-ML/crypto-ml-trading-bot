Regulatory developments from the FDIC on stablecoins could impact market structure. Institutional move by Tether into Speed suggests continued USDT adoption growth. However, CoreWeave’s collapse raises broader systemic risks in AI and infrastructure sectors, potentially affecting crypto mining and cloud computing demand. Overall sentiment is neutral due to conflicting bullish momentum and bearish structural risks."
