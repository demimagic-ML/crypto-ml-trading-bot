      "summary": "The top news highlights MetaMask's long-awaited Bitcoin integration, a major adoption milestone likely to boost BTC demand and sentiment. Regulatory developments around blockchain privacy tools suggest ongoing tension with the SEC, which could impact innovation but not necessarily price negatively. The email security warning is less relevant to crypto markets. Overall, the narrative favors bullish momentum driven by institutional-grade adoption."

This combination of price action and geopolitical attention underscores high urgency for traders to reassess positions."
