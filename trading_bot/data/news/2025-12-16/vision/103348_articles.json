The overall sentiment leans bearish due to the sharp BTC drawdown, though accumulation could suggest a setup for a reversal."

President Trump’s potential impact on crypto policy is highlighted as a major macro factor for 2025. Grayscale downplaying quantum threats adds some stability narrative but does not offset current bearish momentum. The combination of falling prices and political uncertainty suggests a high-impact bearish environment."
