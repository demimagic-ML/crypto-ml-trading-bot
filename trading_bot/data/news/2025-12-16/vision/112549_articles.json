      "summary": "The market is experiencing a broad-based bearish correction with 75% of top 100 coins below key averages, suggesting strong downward momentum. Institutional players like ARK are involved in a sell-off, and recent developments in projects like Axelar show signs of investor concern. This aligns with a risk-off sentiment, especially amid weak ETF performance and lack of catalysts. Immediate caution advised."

No major regulatory or ETF events are reported, but the accumulation trend could be a bullish signal if prices stabilize."
