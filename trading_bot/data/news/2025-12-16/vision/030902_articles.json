A major price drop in Bitcoin near $85,000 is the most significant event, signaling potential sell pressure. Ripple's expansion of its stablecoin (RLUSD) shows ongoing institutional adoption, but this is overshadowed by the negative price action. The mention of a potential pardon for a Bitcoin developer adds speculative interest but lacks immediate impact. Overall, the sentiment is bearish due to the sharp correction in prices."
