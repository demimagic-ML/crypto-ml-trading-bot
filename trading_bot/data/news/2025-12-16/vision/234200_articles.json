      "summary": "Recent news highlights regulatory developments with the FDIC proposing a stablecoin rule, which could influence market structure and institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s price action shows signs of stabilization near $87,500, with derivative positioning suggesting bullish momentum into $85K–$100K. However, sentiment remains mixed due to Bitcoin’s underperformance against equities in Q4, though analysts see this as a positive setup for January. The combination of regulatory movement and technical positioning indicates potential volatility ahead, warranting caution."
