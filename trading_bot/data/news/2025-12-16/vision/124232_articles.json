      "summary": "The market is showing signs of a broad bearish trend with 75% of top 100 cryptocurrencies trading below key technical averages. Bitcoin ETFs are failing to gain traction despite growing institutional interest, signaling caution among large players. Institutional shifts, such as the Circle deal impacting Axelar, and regulatory uncertainty are contributing to a risk-off sentiment. While there is some positive adoption news (StraitsX stablecoin launch), it's overshadowed by dominant negative momentum. This environment suggests a high-risk period for long positions."

      "urgency": "HIGH",
      "summary": "Recent news highlights a mixed but cautiously bearish sentiment for Bitcoin. Long-term holder supply is at an 8-month low, which may signal selling pressure, while whales are accumulating at the fastest rate in 13 years—suggesting potential bottom fishing. Gemini's expansion into prediction markets signals institutional innovation, but lacks direct market-moving impact. The combination of technical weakness and whale activity warrants caution; avoid aggressive entries until clearer trend confirmation."

      "summary": "The top headlines indicate a bearish market tone with Bitcoin and altcoins declining sharply. PayPal's move to obtain a bank charter signals potential institutional crypto integration but is overshadowed by the immediate price sell-off. Trump's comment introduces political uncertainty around privacy-focused wallets. The breaking nature of the price drop and institutional developments suggests high urgency for traders to reassess exposure."
