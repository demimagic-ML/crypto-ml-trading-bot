Regulatory concerns persist with the SEC chief cautioning against overreach, while institutional interest remains mixed—highlighted by BlackRock’s expansion into crypto. The STRD credit spread tightening suggests some institutional positioning for a potential rebound, but current price action favors selling pressure. This is breaking news with high market impact due to price drop and regulatory tone."

Regulatory news suggests potential easing of enforcement, which could be positive long-term, but current market dynamics are dominated by bearish selling pressure. Institutional activity via Anchorage’s acquisition indicates ongoing adoption, but immediate price action is driven by large-scale liquidations."
