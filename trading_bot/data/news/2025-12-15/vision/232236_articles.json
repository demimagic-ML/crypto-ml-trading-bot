      "summary": "Bitcoin has broken below $86,000 amid broader crypto market weakness, signaling a bearish trend. While institutional interest remains (e.g., Tom Lee’s $320M ETH investment), regulatory concerns from the U.S. SEC add uncertainty. The market is reacting negatively to technical breakdowns and macro risks, making this a high-impact breaking event. Traders should consider selling or reducing exposure."
