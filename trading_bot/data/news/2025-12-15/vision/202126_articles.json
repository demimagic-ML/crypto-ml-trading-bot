      "summary": "The top news highlights a potential major Bitcoin price correction, which is bearish, while also noting strong institutional inflows into digital asset ETPs and a significant corporate adoption move by American Bitcoin. The mix of bearish technical warnings and bullish institutional activity creates tension, but the dominant theme is caution due to the parabolic breakdown warning. Given the breaking nature of these updates, especially the veteran trader's call, traders should be cautious and consider reducing exposure."
